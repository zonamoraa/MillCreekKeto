Mill Creek Keto Subsequently the Caveman Mill Creek Keto fixates on eating meat, fish, leafy foods. 
The mantra of the eating routine is that on the off chance that it didn't exist in the Stone Ages, at that point don't eat it. 
Henceforth, individuals on the Paleo Mill Creek Keto don't eat prepared nourishments. 
They likewise don't eat dairy, grains and vegetables as they expect that these things were not part of man's eating regimen during the Stone Ages. 
The nourishments that are a piece of this eating routine are along these lines principally basic food sources in their most essential structures.
